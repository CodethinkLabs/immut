===============================

Authentication tests directly to git server

    SCENARIO Anonymous access to /cgit fails
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/cgit"
    THEN "wget" failed
    AND the "wget" error message includes the string "Authentication Failed"

    SCENARIO Anonymous access to CGit logo fails
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/cgit-data/cgit.png"
    THEN "wget" failed
    AND the "wget" error message includes the string "Authentication Failed"

    SCENARIO Wrong credentials access to /cgit fails
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/cgit" with user "fakeuser" and password "fakepass"
    THEN "wget" failed
    AND the "wget" error message includes the string "Authentication Failed"

    SCENARIO Wrong credentials access to CGit logo fails
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip

    THEN "wget" failed
    AND the "wget" error message includes the string "Authentication Failed"

    SCENARIO Authenticated user access to /cgit succeeds

    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/cgit" with user "testuser" and password "testpass"
    THEN "wget" succeeded

    SCENARIO Authenticated user access to CGit logo succeeds
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/cgit-data/cgit.png" with user "testuser" and password "testpass"
    THEN "wget" succeeded

    SCENARIO Anonymous git-clone of a repository fails
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "git clone" "/git/bar"
    THEN "git clone" failed
    AND the "git clone" error message includes the string "terminal prompts disabled"

    SCENARIO Wrong credentials git-clone of a repository fails
    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "git clone" "/git/bar" with user "fakeuser" and password "fakepass"

    GIVEN a git server running with ip stored in gitserver_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/"
    THEN "wget" failed
    AND file "index.html" includes the string "Test Page for the Apache HTTP Server on Fedora"

Authentication tests through HAProxy

    SCENARIO Authenticated user access to /cgit through haproxy succeeds
    GIVEN a haproxy server running with ip stored in haproxy_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "wget" "/cgit" with prefix "gitserver.test" with user "testuser" and password "testpass"
    THEN "wget" succeeded

    SCENARIO Authenticated user git-clone of a repository through haproxy succeeds
    GIVEN a haproxy server running with ip stored in haproxy_ip
    WHEN user attempts to "git clone" "/git/bar" with prefix "gitserver.test" with user "testuser" and password "testpass"
    THEN "git clone" succeeded

    SCENARIO Anonymous access to / through haproxy returns Apache test page
    GIVEN a haproxy server running with ip stored in haproxy_ip
